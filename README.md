# 🚗 Parking Lot Allotment System

This is a **Java console application** that simulates an efficient Parking Lot System for managing bikes, cars, and trucks.

It was designed to handle:
- 🏍 **Bikes** (space = 1)
- 🚗 **Cars** (space = 4)
- 🚚 **Trucks** (space = 8)

It ensures optimal allocation by parking bikes first in bike slots, then in car or truck slots if needed. Similarly for cars and trucks.

## 📂 Features

✅ **Vehicle Parking & Allocation**
- 🏍 Bikes park in bike slots first, then car, then truck slots.
- 🚗 Cars park in car slots first, then truck slots.
- 🚚 Trucks park only in truck slots.

🔄 **Dynamic Re-allocation**
- If a vehicle leaves, the system intelligently moves bikes from car/truck slots back to bike slots, and cars from truck slots to car slots if space becomes available.

🚫 **Duplicate Plate Check**
- The system rejects vehicles with duplicate number plates.

🖥 **Parking Lot Views**
- View current parking lot allocation for bikes, cars, and trucks.

🔎 **Parking Slot Details**
- Given a number plate, find where the vehicle is parked.
